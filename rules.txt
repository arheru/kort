CLAMBER - Henrik Lysell 2015-2016
A card game for 3+ players. Race to the top! Step on your friends! Don't get engulfed by the horrible death that is the Skittering!

################# Setup

- All players start on position 5.

- The Skittering starts on position 0.

- The deck consisting of 53 cards (Henrik: maybe 52?) is shuffled and set in the middle of the table.

- Roles are determined by drawing a card from a special deck of role cards. Each player keeps his or her role card face down until the end of the game, but he or she can look at the card at any time during play.

- Each player draws 4 cards.

################# Gameplay

- Played in turns. Players go clockwise around the table.

- The Skittering increases its position by 1 at the start of every turn, and also at the very start of the game, i.e. turn 1 begins with the Skittering moving to position 1 from 0.

- After the Skittering advances, win and loss conditions are checked. These conditions are as follows:
        * Any players with a position equal or less than that of the Skittering dies.
        * Any players with a position equal or greater than the goal position leaves the well.

- Each player plays a card and puts the card's effect into play. Playing a card is mandatory, and no more than one card can be played per turn.

- When a player in any way and at any time reaches position 10 or more, that player sees the position of the goal.

- Goal position is determined when the first player reaches position 10. That player rolls 1D6, memorises the result and covers the dice with e.g. a cup for other players to see when they reach position 10 or more. Goal position is at 14 + the result of the dice, i.e. 15-20.
