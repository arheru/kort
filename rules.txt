CLAMBER - Henrik Lysell 2015-2016
A card game for 3+ players. Race to the top! Step on your friends! Don't get engulfed by the horrible death that is the Skittering!

################# Setup

- All players start on position 5.

- The Skittering starts on position 0.

- The deck consisting of 53 cards (Henrik: maybe 52?) is shuffled and set in the middle of the table.

- Each player draws 4 cards.

################# Gameplay

- Played in turns. Players go clockwise around the table.

- The Skittering increases its position by 1 at the start of every turn, and also at the very start of the game, i.e. turn 1 begins with the Skittering moving to position 1 from 0.

- After the Skittering advances, win and loss conditions are checked. These conditions are as follows:
        * Any players with a position equal or less than that of the Skittering dies.
        * Any players with a position equal or greater than the goal position leaves the well.

- Each player plays a card and puts the card's effect into play. Playing a card is mandatory, and no more than one card can be played per turn.

- When a player in any way and at any time reaches position 10 or more, that player sees the position of the goal.

- Goal position is determined when the first player reaches position 10. That player rolls 1D6, memorises the result and covers the dice with e.g. a cup for other players to see when they reach position 10 or more. Goal position is at 14 + the result of the dice, i.e. 15-20.
